This C# program demonstrates reading student details from a text file, performing sorting based on student names, and searching for a specific student by name.



1.The program defines a class Student, which has properties nm (name) and Class (class number).

2.Inside the Main method, the program reads student details from  "E:\Dotnet\Ph1-PracticeProject2\students.txt".
	 It then stores the student details in a list of Student objects.       

3.The program first prints all the student details in the original order, displaying the student's name and class.

4.Next, the program performs sorting on the list of students based on their names using LINQ's OrderBy method, and then prints the sorted list.

5.The program then prompts the user to enter a name for searching in the list.

6.It uses LINQ's Where method to find students with a matching name and stores the result in a new list.
7.If there are students found with the entered name, it prints the names and their corresponding classes. If no matching student is found, it displays an error message.

8.Finally, the program waits for user input before closing.
